        <h2>Challenge 3: Space War </h2>
        <p>
          In the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/node/75811">last
          challenge</a> of our course we were supposed to program an
          AI for the game Space War, a real time strategy game in
          which two players struggle for the ownership of a cluster of planets.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have been interesting to solve the problem with an
          algorithm derived with an evolutionary metaheuristic but I
          couldn't come up with a way to do that in a sensible way
          fast enough so I gave up on the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought it would be a good idea to use the sample java bot
          as a base for my AI and started hacking away. I implemented
          a bot that would give planets scores were supposed to
          reflect the profitability of attacking them. The bot would
          then attack the most profitable one. It would try to figure
          out if the enemy could be killed right away by attacking
          furiously and attempt to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried adding features to the bot but couldn't get them to
          work. I soon realised that the bot was full of bugs and I
          wasn't very eager to try to debug them so I did what any
          sensible programmer would do and began a rewrite from
          scratch in python on the last day of the challenge :-)
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I reversed my inequality signs and sorted lists
          in the wrong order uncountably many times it didn't take
          long to have my python bot beat my old java one.           
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up with an algorithm that calculates a rough
          profitability index for each planet. Bigger planets are
          given a higher index than smaller ones and enemy planets are
          given a higher one than neutral ones. Also, the less ships
          there are present the better. Before these indexes are taken
          into account, my bot sends ships to planets with very small
          populations (less than 3) because otherwise it would often
          not attack them. Later versions of my bot would also look for enemy ships
          heading towards own planets and attempt to protect them from
          being overrun.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason I wasn't able to run my newest versions of
          the bot on the server, the replays show them doing nothing
          even though they worked on my computer so I wasn't able to
          test any version that could protect its planets on the game
          server. Still, my bot seemed to work reasonably
          well against the organizers' bots but it did get beaten up quite
          badly by bots from other players.
