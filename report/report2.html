        <h2>Challenge 2: Repeated Prisoner's Challenge </h2>
        <p>
          The topic
          of <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/node/75723">challenge
          number two</a> was repeated prisoner's dilemma, a version of
          the well known prisoner's dilemma in which the game is
          played a number of times against the same opponent and the
          prison years are summed up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this challenge there are 8 opposing AI of which all but
          two use a known strategy. One game is 100 rounds long and
          the scores against all the bots are summed up in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          An optimal score in this challenge could easily be attained by
          figuring out a short move sequence that would trigger unique
          responses from each of the opposing AI players and select
          the optimal strategy against the detected AI. I decided
          against doing this as it would not have been a very
          interesting approach and there was to be a tournament of
          student AIs playing against each other in the end in which
          the strategy would probably have failed very badly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out by implementing a the well known tit-for-tat
          player which starts off by cooperating, then playing the
          opponents previous move. Tit-for-tat is known to be one of
          the overall best strategies for repeated prisoner's dilemma
          and it's very easy to implement. This fared pretty well
          against many of the opposing strategies but got a score that
          few hundred over the required minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I was not very likely to find a general strategy that
          would fare well enough against the given set of opponents I
          decided to add a few tweaks that would target the given
          opponents without altering the basic tit-for-tat mechanism
          too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I added a second round of cooperation at the beginning of
          each match. This avoided going into a loop of always making
          the worst decision against the tit-for-tat which starts off
          by defecting. Next I added simple methods for detecting if
          the opponent always cooperates, always chooses the opposing
          move my AI did on the last round and playing randomly.
          Against these AIs my bot would simply defect on each round.
          The final tweak I made was always defecting on the last
          round.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these straightforward rules my AI was able to get a
          decent score and still play pretty close to the normal
          tit-for-tat rules against most opponents. It would not have
          been hard to reverse engineer the secret strategies and
          making methods to try and detect them and choose an optimal
          counter strategy but I decided it wouldn't be very
          interesting and didn't to that.
