        <h2>Challenge 1: ASCII Art </h2>
        <p>In the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/node/75600">first
            challenge</a> we were tasked with recreating given
          input images using a given amount of letters that could be given
          a colour, size, position and rotation.</p>
        <p>I came up with a two possible ways of tackling the problem.
          The first technique would be trying to place letters one by one,
          trying to find an optimal place for each single. I thought an
          algorithm like gradient descent might do the job well
          enough.</p>
        <p>The way I ended up solving the problem was a simple
          evolutionary algorithm like the one
          mentioned <a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">here</a>.
          The algorithm has the following steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Make a random list of letters</li>
            <li>Make some copies of the list of letters generated and
              randomize some letters in them</li>
            <li>Take the one with the smallest distance to the source
              image and go to step 1</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          I mainly chose this algorithm over the first one because I was
          lazy and this seemed like less work. The first thing I noticed
          was that the cost function took way too long to compute.
          Something had to be done. I found two possible ways to fix
          this. Either I could scale down the images in the beginning
          and scale the letters to match the size of the source image or
          I could simply compare only a few of the pixels when
          calculating the cost. Resizing the image gave somewhat a
          bigger boost but as I couldn't have been bothered with scaling
          the letters back to the input size, I went with the second
          approach which turned out to be fast enough.
        </p>
        <p>After playing around with my first version of this algorithm
          for a night using Tux as the source I was ready to
          conclude that it could only produce heaps of letters that were
          somewhat clumped in the middle of the picture.

                                                            test">



        <p>
          I was pretty stuck for a while. The Mona Lisa article seemed
          to use an algorithm identical to mine for the parts that
          mattered and I had run the algorithm for quite many cycles but
          my results were awful. So I did what any reasonable person
          would do. I decided to make my code parallel and run it with
          more iterations, after all, the Mona Lisa was evolved from
          triangles, not letters so the search space would have been
          smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
          After figuring out how to get my generations generated in
          parallel and tweaking my letter randomization algorithm so
          that it gave me letters within reasonable bounds I left
          ukko137 to compute 700 000 generations of size 16 for the
          night and got the result on the left.
        </p>

          This was the first image of tux that I created that was good
          enough to pass the given requirement. But more importantly, it
          told me what was wrong. I was mutating lists of letters by
          swapping some letters with totally random ones. It was the
          easiest thing to do but It meant that after a letter had found
          decent parameters, it was quite unlikely for a random letter
          to be swapped in its place. What I had to do was make the
          mutation alter the letters instead. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After I had gotten my letter alteration method working and
          squashed an unbelievable amount of silly bugs I had to find
          good parameters so that the algorithm would converge fast in
          the beginning but wouldn't get stuck later on. I made a few
          plots of how the evolution progressed but I didn't have the
          patience for systematically making plots with different
          parameters run times long enough to be too informative but I
          did make some observations. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that giving the image one mutation at a time gave results superior
          to giving it many. I also found that, although it's a good
          idea to begin by making larger mutations, the size of the
          mutations should not be lowered very low at any point or the
          algorithm will get stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I had tweaked the algorithm I was able to surpass my
          earlier rendering of tux in only 1,5 minutes instead of the 7
          I used earlier. Now I felt confident enough to leave the ukko
          cluster to run my program for the night and go to sleep. In
          the morning I was greeted by the following pictures, all of
          which passed with descent scores.
